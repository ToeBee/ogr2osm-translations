ogr2osm translation files
=========

This is a place to put some ogr2osm translatin files I have written and used for various things.

Note that there are now two versions of ogr2osm and the translation files are not compatible with each other. 

The old one is currently in OSM subversion:

http://svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/utils/import/ogr2osm/

The new one is on github:

https://github.com/andrewguertin/ogr2osm

The new one has some more powerful features available in the translation file such as filtering out objects during the conversion process. The old one uses translation files strictly as an attribute-to-tag mapping method.
